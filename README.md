Chicago Public Datasets Project
Project Overview
This project aims to analyze various public datasets related to the City of Chicago, including public schools, crime rates, and census data. By cleaning and organizing these datasets, the goal is to uncover insights into how different factors, such as educational institutions and census statistics, correlate with crime rates across different areas in Chicago.

The project includes cleaned datasets, original datasets, Python scripts for data processing, SQL scripts for querying, and Power BI visualizations.

Repository Structure
/data/:

cleaned_datasets/: Cleaned versions of the datasets used for analysis.
cleaned_ChicagoPublicSchools.csv: Cleaned dataset for public school data in Chicago.
cleaned_ChicagoCrimeData.csv: Cleaned dataset for crime data in Chicago.
